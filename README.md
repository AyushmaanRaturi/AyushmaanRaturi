-- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python because it's taught in my school. So by starting a new programming language I don't want to confuse my self in the synatx and
     other stuff
-- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that makes people's life easier
-- 📫 How to reach me? Nice qquestion BTW !! Here's my gmail i'd you can mail me on that: ayushmaanraturi@gmail.com (pretty long Haha!)
